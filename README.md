# Running the script

You will need the following:
- Set your working directory where your matrix is located
	- You can change to any score matrix that you need
- Put the two sequences that you will want to align in the s1 and s2 variables

# Limitations

- The script does not have sensitivity between gapOpenings and gapExtension and, by default the gapPenalty is -1
